      <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>

        protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps
        to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware
        that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or

        against any interception or other type of misuse.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Policy for Children</h2>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under
        the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information
        from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we
        will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe we
        might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
        contact us.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
        Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your
        privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
        do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
        a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
        this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
